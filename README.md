Hi, my name is Alidu Ali,
I'm a passtionate frontend developer, enjoy learning new skills and currently exployring my way to be coming a software engineer in 2023.
I grew up from a community without electricity and I have to go a long distance to enjoy the internet.
Fun fact about me is I love linux.
One word to discribe is I'm super loyal.
I like to connect with new people and down for collaboration.
